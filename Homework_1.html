    <p>International Women's Day (IWD) is a global holiday celebrated annually on March 8 as a focal point in the women's rights movement.

    <p>The earliest reported Women's Day event, called "National Woman's Day", was held on February 28, 1909, in New York City. It was organized by the Socialist Party of America at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel. There have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on March 8, 1857, but researchers have alleged this to be a myth intended to detach International Women's Day from its socialist origin</p>

    <p>On March 8, 1917, in Petrograd (February 23, 1917, on the Julian calendar), women textile workers began a demonstration that eventually engulfed the whole city, demanding "Bread and Peace"—an end to World War I, to food shortages, and to czarism. This marked the beginning of the February Revolution, which alongside the October Revolution, made up the second Russian Revolution. Revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without a date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for the support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets." Seven days later, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, and the provisional Government granted women the right to vote</p>

            <ol>
                    <li><b>Simone de Beauvoir</b> - An outspoken political activist, writer and social theorist, in 1949 de Beauvoir wrote The Second Sex, an ahead-of-its-time book credited with paving the way for modern feminism.</li>
                    <li><b>Eleanor Roosevelt</b> - Roosevelt became the first First Lady to take on responsibilities beyond merely hosting and entertaining in the White House. From 1935 to 1962, Roosevelt wrote "My Day," a newspaper column that addressed women's work, equality and rights.</li>
                    <li><b>Marlene Dietrich</b> - While her efforts didn't directly fight for women's rights, Dietrich made a contribution to feminism through fashion.The Hollywood actress wore trousers and men's suits during a time where it was considered extremely scandalous and taboo; both on screen and privately, once almost being arrested for wearing pants in public during the 1930s. She was famously quoted saying, "I dress for the image. Not for myself, not for the public, not for fashion, not for men."
                    <li><b>Betty Friedan</b> - The American writer and activist penned The Feminine Mystique in 1963, which is often credited for sparking the second wave of feminism that began in the '60s and '70s.

                    <li><b>Gloria Steinem</b> - Aptly referred to as the "Mother of Feminism," Gloria Steinem led the women's liberation movements throughout the '60s and '70s—and continues to do so today.
